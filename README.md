# Dark Pattern Detector

In response to the growing prevalence of deceptive online practices, we present a sophisticated browser extension tailored for detecting and mitigating dark patterns. Leveraging the robust Navies Bayes model trained on a comprehensive dataset sourced from KG Mathur, comprising over 11,000 websites, our solution is equipped to identify and classify 12 distinct types of dark patterns with precision.

A key feature of our extension is its seamless integration with Gemini AI, which provides nuanced insights into the specific dark patterns employed by websites. This dual-layered approach not only enhances detection accuracy but also empowers users with actionable intelligence to navigate the digital landscape securely.

Moreover, our extension offers an innovative functionality whereby users can effortlessly assess the legitimacy of a website in real-time. By simply clicking the 'detect' button, users receive instant notifications via SMS on their registered phone number, enabling informed decision-making and safeguarding against potential online threats.

Through rigorous validation and testing, our solution demonstrates efficacy in promoting transparency and enhancing user safety online, thereby contributing to a more trustworthy digital environment.
